# Advent of Code 2022

## Background
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) is an advent calendar of programming puzzles.

Each day from December 1 - December 25, 2 puzzles are given to solve.

## Goals
I'm doing Advent of Code for 2 primary reasons:
1. To dust off my Python skills
2. Learn more about Unit Testing

## Progress:
